# Adding Integration "Every duration when status is something notify person via a bulk notification"

The following Bulk Remind Demo dashboard is a simplified CRM board. 

The board contains clients with a status column that can group clients by:

- No Response 
- Reached Out 
- Meeting Set 

There are two groups in this example which are "Leads" and "Contacts". 

The remaining columns include "follow up" dates and "notes" about a particular client.
