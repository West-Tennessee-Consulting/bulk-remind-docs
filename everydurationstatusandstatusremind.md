# Adding Integration "Every Duration When Status is Something and Status is Something Notify Someone with Subject via a Bulk Notification"

This integration feature creates a consolidated reminder that triggers when two status column values match specified trigger conditions. 

To understand this better please review the sample board section below. 


## Sample Board 

This example sample board contains two status columns. 

The column "Status" has three possible labels.

- Reaching Out 
- No Response 
- Meeting Set 

The column "Invoice" has four possible labels.

- Not Started 
- Estimate Sent
- Pending Payment 
- Done

Knowing how many leads were contacted with a sent estimate would be useful information to include in a consolidated reminder.

In this guide we are going to show how to add a recipe which sends a bulk reminder if two status conditions are met.

We will provide screenshots and video clips along the way to help guide you to make your first test invoice.
